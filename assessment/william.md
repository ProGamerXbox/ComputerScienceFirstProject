For the programming project, I was working with Marius and Tom. At the beginning we were doing the research together and all of our three were giving advice to each otherâ€™s research. Which is about 5% of the total works.


Then after that I was doing the flowchart for the program. Then they provided a bit advice to me, so I improved the flowchart in the end. Which roughly about 20% of the program project.


After that part we were starting the coding part of the project. Marius is the most advanced person in our group and he is very efficient, which means that he nearly finished the whole code by himself which means that he did the most work for the entire code part. I will count it as 50% of the whole project.


But at the end, Marius, Tom and I are communicating bit more often which we improve the whole program together. At the end , in my opinion, I think both me and Tom did 25% each, and Marius did 50% of the project. It is a good experience to work and communicate with these two which is why we keep working together for our next project or research.
