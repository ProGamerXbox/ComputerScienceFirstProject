I did about 25% of the contribution towards the group project mainly in terms of the coding side to it. I did the parts of if the guess is wrong, then the program takes a guess away (number) from a variable until it reaches a certain point and also when it reaches the certain point it will output what the word is if the word was not guessed already. And also for the program to repeat asking for a letter when a letter has been entered.


I should have participated in more of the coding side to it and help out in that area and solve the problems that were caused in the project as it was getting written. Time management with other pieces of work around the project, having been set a lot of work during the course of the project, I should have been managing when I do that work and when I have a time to do some coding for the project or focusing on getting the other work done sooner so I have more time to do coding.
