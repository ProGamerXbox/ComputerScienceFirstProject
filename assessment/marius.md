### Contributions

I contributed about 50% of the whole project. We researched as a team about the rules and requirements at the beginning of the project. I have done most of the coding part of the project : writing the code logic and structure as well as testing and fixing.

- 50%
- code logic
- most of the coding part
- researched made for the requirements

### Reflection

Something I wished I've would have done better was communicating : letting more work to my teammates, organising for a better equally splited work between all teammates. Communicate more often and efficiently with the team about the progress made. I would do better researches, breaking down problems more and optimize the code to make it more efficient  as well as more human readable.

- would have done more:
    - communications
    - work split
    - focus on teamwork
    - researches
    - breaking down problems
    - code optimization
